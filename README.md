- `src/components/`: folder for simple stateless components : Navbar and Single Issue
- `src/containers/`: folder for stateful components : Homepage and NewFeed Page
- `src/redux/actions`: each file in this folder is related to a set of actions, e.g. `issue.actions.js` 
- `src/redux/reducers`: set of reducers that are combined in `index.js`
- `src/redux/constants`: set of types of actions
- `src/redux/store.js`: configuration of the store
- *Note*: while there is no need to use Combined actions/reducer/contants  it is my decision to include it in case of futher requirements of the project. E.g Authentication .. 

### Technical decision

1. How did you implement styling? What are the pros and cons? Why did you chose this approach?

   I use bootstrap to do most of the styling structure since the app is relative small so that would be the most efficent though it is quite unflexible and less of artistic side.

   Moreover, with conditional styling, I use variable from redux store to able to maintain selection   
   Another reason is that this is the approach I feel comfortable of using at the moment  

2. How did you share state between components? What are the pros and cons? Why did you chose this approach?

   I used both props and redux to manage my state.
   With state like **currentpage** and **setcurrentpage** I will sent as props to every single issue items   
   For state like **selection** I would useSelector from redux to pick out the current state of the selection rather than have to send as props to newsfeed page and also avoid sending to PublicNavbar  
   I am also using redux to store article retrieved from api call that I have not using much. However, as if the app need to be improve on performance, I would be able to store data to state everytime user load newpage. Then rerender from redux store when Pagination happens (especially, go to previous page) to prevent waste api call to the sever for previous loaded issues   

3. Did you use React hooks? Why or why not?
      Yes, I used React hooks.
      Because Im coding this app in functional component style⋅⋅

4. How did you prevent wasted renders?
      asad 
      asad  

5. How did you handle side-effects (e.g. data fetching)? What are the pros and cons? Why did you chose this approach?
